# BRIL

This is the analysis code generated to study the output from https://github.com/gauzinge/BRIL_ITsim branch jcordero

  * BRILanalyzer.ipynb = Analysis code to fit a CB distribution to the cluster counts for each disk and ring [This is a old code that was made before working on the stand alone simulation of the hits and cluster counts]
  * BRIL_Ana.ipynb 
      * Analysis code used to study the several Cluster variables, 
      * Focus on the R-projection of the disks. Care was taken to normalize for the number of modules per ring and  eliminating the gaps between rings
